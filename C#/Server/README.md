# MUD Server

The code in this section is for the work-in-progress MUD Server. 

Currently working on the asynchronous logging in, and implementing the database.
    Possible future work in transfering the DB functions to a MySQL or SQL Server dedicated instance instead of the SQL Server CE currently planned for portability.
